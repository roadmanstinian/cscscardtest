Hi

This is CITB HS&E book (CSCS card test) PDF 
parsed into a multiple choice question quiz

There are 461 questions in this question bank
If you manage to get 45/50 in the exam (90%)
over 50minutes then you can apply for CSCS card

I made this because health and safety awareness
is helpful for any kind of physical craft.

I honestly wish I had full confidence when working
on DIY projects as a teenager so I didn't risk
taking out an eye (They really should've drilled 
this knowledge into us at school, this is obviously
more important then listening to ozymandias masturbate his ego)
