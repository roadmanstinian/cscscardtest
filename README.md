Hi

This is CITB HS&E book (CSCS card test) PDF 
parsed into a multiple choice question quiz

There are 461 questions in this question bank.
If you manage to get 45/50 in the exam (90%)
over 50minutes then you can apply for CSCS card

I made this because it is another tool to get a perfect grade.
health and safety awareness is helpful for any kind of physical craft.

Direction I want to go with it:
- Score out of how many completed on a counter
- Stopwatch score
- Timer for all questions
- Timer for that individual question in test conditions
- Leaderboard for speedruns
- Leaderboard for speedruns for that specific question
- Diagram submission function for questions under a "hint" spoiler
- Nmemonic Submission function for questions under a "hint" spoiler
- Daily Leaderboard
- Weekly Leaderboard
- monthly leaderboard
- Sponsership by the industry
- Android/IoS app (pref. f-droid)
