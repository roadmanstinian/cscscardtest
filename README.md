Hi

This is CITB HS&E book (CSCS card test) PDF 
parsed into a multiple choice question quiz

There are 461 questions in this question bank.
If you manage to get 45/50 in the exam (90%)
over 50minutes then you can apply for CSCS card

I made this because it is another tool to get a perfect grade.
As someone diagnosed with dyslexia I am well practised in using
unconvential methods to memorise information for exams. The functions
I wish to implement below utilise some of those methods to maximise
memorisation through the paradigm of maximising connections of different
parts of the brain on one topic area, and also gameifying the process. 

I hope this is laying the groundwork for learning essential skills (e.g. not dying) in a manner which is for the man who sits there and daydreams when faced with a pen and highlighter.



Direction I want to go with it:
- Score out of how many completed on a counter
- Stopwatch score
- Timer for all questions
- Timer for that individual question in test conditions
- Leaderboard for speedruns
- Leaderboard for speedruns for that specific question
- Diagram submission function for questions under a "hint" spoiler
- Nmemonic Submission function for questions under a "hint" spoiler
- Daily Leaderboard
- Weekly Leaderboard
- monthly leaderboard
- Sponsership by the industry
- Android/IOS app (pref. f-droid)
- Audio only (to help mental connection)
- Diagram only (to help build mental connection)
- Hand Gesticulation only (I have no idea how that can be assessed)
- Assessment via reading out the question and answer outloud
- Nmemonic Sing-a-long question and answers assessment
- Typing out the exact question and answer (for serious perfectionists)
- Theraputic Arts and Crafts suggestions section and gallery (for those wanting to enhance mental connections)
